title: Normalized Hash tests for RSpec
summary: These are RSpec tests for Normalized Hash data structure standard.  
description: |
             Main goal specification is to make data produced by Uliska parser easy to use by software that does not know about internal data structure, i.e. data driven and schema-less. Data structures should be built in such a way as to make data self-documenting, easy adaptable and "software-friendly".

These are RSpec tests for Normalized Hash data structure standard. Standard itself and rationale why we (I) need it, is described in NormalizedHash.md file.


RSpec deep hash tests were insired by https://github.com/vitalish/rspec-deep-matchers specs.
