title: RSpec tests for Normalized Hash 
summary: |
  Hash with additional requirements, to ensure easy parseable data structure. Set RSpec tests for it.
description: |
  Specification to make data produced by data parser of server inventory scanner  easy to use by software that does not know about internal data structure, i.e. data driven and schema-less. Data structures should be built in such a way as to make data self-documenting, easy adaptable and "software-friendly".

These are RSpec tests for Normalized Hash data structure standard. Standard itself and rationale why we (I) need it, is described in NormalizedHash.md file.


RSpec deep hash tests were inspired by <https://github.com/vitalish/rspec-deep-matchers specs>


h2. Usage

h3. Installation

Rspec NormalizedHash test released as gem, install it as:

<pre>
        gem install rspec_normalized_hash
</pre>

h3. Example

<pre>

   require 'rspec_normalized_hash'

   describe "Good data structure" do

       before(:each) { subject @data }

       it { should have_keys_in_class [String, Symbol] }
       it { should have_values_in_class [Fixnum, String, Numeric, Hash, Array] }
       it { should have_array_values_in_class [String,Numeric,Hash] }
       it { should have_array_values_of_the_same_class }

       it { NOT IMPLEMENTED: enclosed arrays in Hash }
   end
                                   
</pre>
