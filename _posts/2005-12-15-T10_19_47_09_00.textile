h1. Create a case-sensitive HFS boot disk

''Authored by: jay2 on Tue, Feb 8 '05 at 02:18PM''

I've set up two macs (both running 10.3.x) with case-sensitive boot disks by doing the following:

* use "carbon copy cloner":http://www.bombich.com/software/ccc.html to make a bootable backup on a firewire disk
* boot from the backup
* open a terminal window and incant:
+ sudo diskutil eraseVolume "Case-sensitive HFS+" "Macintosh HD" /Volumes/Macintosh HD
+ (that's all on one line)
* restore from the backup to the newly formatted HD 

cccloner makes it a piece of cake. i did this over a year ago, and have had no problems with case-sensitive hfs+.
