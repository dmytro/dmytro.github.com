p(narrow). This page contains short description of several software projects I was working on, either as part of my job, or for fun. For software developed as part of my job, tehre's short description, and probably a couple of screenshots. If it's a hobby, then it's an open source, and there's also pointer to source code. Please feel free to use, to re-distribute, to critic and to contribute.
