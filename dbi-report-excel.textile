DBIx::Report::Excel designed to make creating reports in MSExcel format from database easy. It's aimed at SQL developers and/or DBA'  who don't know much about Perl programming. I.e. most of the information needed to create Excel file is provided directly in SQL statement (script) itself.

Source code of DBIx::Report::Excel also hosted "at Github":http://github.com/dmytro/DBIx-Report-Excel. Contributions and bug-fixes are welcomed.
