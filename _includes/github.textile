* "WebiPhoto":web-iphoto - client side web album. Use iPhoto data, photos to browse albums in web
  browser. 

  Idea of this is very simple.  iPhoto keeps all its photos
  in well organized directories YYYY/MM/DD, creates thumbnails for all
  photos and since version 8.x also all albums' information is kept in
  Sqlite embedded database.  So, to make photos available on the web
  you just need to create couple of HTML files in iPhoto library
  directory and export data from SQL into JSON files. Of course,
  because it is called Web iPhoto you'd need to write some Javascript
  to make your app look like iPhoto.

* "Uliska":uliska - UNIX, Linux Inventory and Configuration Scanner

* "Ulivie":ulivie - Web and command line viewer and differ for Uliska
