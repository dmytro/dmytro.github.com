    Translations of the GPL
 
   These translations are not official. Legally speaking, the
   original (English) version of the GPL is what specifies the
   actual distribution terms for GNU programs.
 
   The reason the FSF does not approve these translations as
   officially valid is that checking them would be difficult
   and expensive (needing the help of bilingual lawyers in
   other countries). Even worse, if an error did slip through,
   the results could be disastrous for the whole free software
   community. As long as the translations are unofficial, they
   can't do any harm, and we hope they help more people
   understand the GPL.
 
   We give permission to publish translations of the GPL,
   GFDL, or LGPL into other languages, provided that you (1)
   label your translations as unofficial (see below for how to
   do this), to inform people that they do not count legally
   as substitutes for the authentic version, and (2) you agree
   to install changes at our request, if we learn from other
   friends of GNU that changes are necessary to make the
   translation clearer.
 
   To label your translations as unofficial we want you to add
   the following text at the beginning, both in English and in
   the language of the translation---replacing language with
   the name of that language:
 
     This is an unofficial translation of the GNU General
     Public License into language. It was not published by
     the Free Software Foundation, and does not legally state
     the distribution terms for software that uses the GNU
     GPL--only the original English text of the GNU GPL does
     that. However, we hope that this translation will help
     language speakers understand the GNU GPL better.
