[no-disks]http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=76050

 There are several issues when making Debian to be able to be installed
 by Cobbler. 

* First of all current (6.0.5) Debian netboot installer is broken. It
 fails with "No disks found" message, reason being that no IDE, SCSI
 or SATA udebs are included with netboot installer. This "has been
 reported"no-disks but not fixed yet. The only way to fix this issue
 seems to be rebuild the installer from scratch.

* Additionally I wanted to avoid any questions asked by
 installer--make it fully unattended. This requires some addition to
 Debian's netboot @initrd@ file.

 Setup you system using instruction at  "Debian Installer page":build

@# apt-get build-dep debian-installer@
@# dpkg-checkbuilddeps@

 In my case it gave me warning about missing win32-loader > 0.7.2,
 this is package from Wheeze (7.0) but Squeeze has only 0.6x. So I had
 to download `deb` from "Wheezy mirror":win32-loader and install it
 manually:

@# wget http://ftp.yz.yamagata-u.ac.jp/debian/pool/main/w/win32-loader/win32-loader_0.7.4.3_all.deb@
@# dpkg --install win32-loader_0.7.4.3_all.deb@
