summary: |
  When a while ago I was selecting name for my new project I didn't have slightest idea that Nagira is actually somebody's name.

  Nagira sounded to me as a name, I thought it was more like a female name, maybe of Persian origins. It was a bit of surprize for me to type 'nagira' in google and see more than 100 000 hits.

So, I've discovered that 'Nagira' _**is a name**_, but not female, and not Persian, but rather Japanese and male.

So, today on  my way to work I see this real life example - Nagira's concert in Asakusa Jinja.
