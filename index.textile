This page contains short description of several software projects I was working on, either as part of my work assignment, or as a hobby. For soft that was developed as part of my job, it's mostly short description, and probably a couple of screenshot. If it's a hobby, then it's an open source, and there's also pointer to source code. Please feel free to use, to re-distribute, to critic and to contribute.

* WebiPhoto 

  Idea of this is very simple.  iPhoto keeps all its photos
  in well organized directories YYYY/MM/DD, creates thumbnails for all
  photos and since version 8.x also all albums' information is kept in
  Sqlite embedded database.  So, to make photos available on the web
  you just need to create couple of HTML files in iPhoto library
  directory and export data from SQL into JSON files. Of course,
  because it is called Web iPhoto you'd need to write some Javascript
  to make your app look like iPhoto.
