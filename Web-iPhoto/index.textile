p(description). Client side web album. Use iPhoto data, photos to
browse albums in web browser. Mimics iPhoto UI in browser.

    
Web iPhoto (or  wiPhoto) is a client side  web album application. Main
use  for it is  thought to  browse iPhoto  picture collections  in web
browser without need of iPhoto application.

iPhoto keeps all its  photos in well organized directories YYYY/MM/DD,
creates  thumbnails for  all photos  and  since version  8.x also  all
albums' information is kept in  Sqlite embedded database.  So, to make
photos available  on the web  you just need  to create couple  of HTML
files in iPhoto  library directory and export data  from SQL into JSON
files. Of course, because it is  called Web iPhoto you'd need to write
some Javascript to make your app look like iPhoto.  </p>
