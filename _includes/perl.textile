* "DBIx::Report::Excel":http://search.cpan.org/~dmytro/DBIx-Report-Excel-0.4/

DBIx::Report::Excel designe to make creating reports in MS Excel format from database easy. It's aimed at SQL developers and/or DBA'  who don't know much about Perl programming. I.e. most of the  information needed to create Excel file is provided directly in SQL  statement (script) itself.

Source code of DBIx::Report::Excel also hosted "at Github":http://github.com/dmytro/DBIx-Report-Excel. Contributions and bug-fixes are welcomed.

* "Log::Simplest":http://search.cpan.org/~dmytro/Log-Simplest-1.0/

Simple log module. Writes log messages to file and/or STDERR. With minimum efforts.

* "Mac::iPhoto":http://search.cpan.org/~dmytro/Mac-iPhoto-0.1/

Reads in photo albums plist files of iPhoto.app on MacOS X and  presents them as perl data structure. Note, this is already dead  project, because format of plist file in iPhoto has changed several  times since module was written. Until it was finally abandoned  completely and Apple switched to use Sqlite to store albums  information in iPhoto. Look at "WebiPhoto":web-iphoto at Github instead.
